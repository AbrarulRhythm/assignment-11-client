### 📚 eTuitionBd | Tuition Management System

eTuitionBd is a comprehensive platform designed to bridge the gap between qualified tutors and students seeking academic support. It streamlines the tuition process through automated workflows, allowing students to post requirements, tutors to apply for opportunities, and administrators to oversee the entire ecosystem through a secure, role-based dashboard.

### 🧐 Purpose
Finding verified tutors or legitimate tuition posts can be a friction-filled process. eTuitionBd solves this by providing a transparent, digital environment for class tracking, secure Stripe-integrated payments, and a structured verification system to ensure quality and trust for both parties.

## ✨ Key Features
### 👤 User Roles & Dashboards
- **Student Dashboard:** Post tuition requirements (subject, budget, location), manage applications, and make secure payments via Stripe to hire tutors.
- **Tutor Dashboard:** Browse tuitions with advanced filtering, track application statuses, manage ongoing tuitions, and view revenue history.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Centralized control for user management (role updates/deletions), tuition post moderation, and financial analytics.

### 🔐 Security & Authentication
- **JWT Authentication:** Role-based access control and token verification to secure private routes.
- **Firebase Auth:** Social (Google) and Email/Password login integration.
- **Protected Routes:** Strict redirection logic to prevent unauthorized access.

### 🛠 Functional Highlights
- **Dynamic Search & Filter:** Search tuitions by subject/tutorgender and filter by class or budget.
- **Real-time Status:** Automated status updates (Pending → Approved/Rejected/Closed) for tuition posts and tutor applications.
- **Payment Integration:** Tutors are only officially "Approved" once the student completes the salary payment via Stripe.
